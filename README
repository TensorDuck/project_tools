Software for doing multiscale modeling in Dr. Cecilia Clementi's research group
at Rice University. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Purpose:
    The purpose of this software is to make multiscale, combining coarse-grain
and all-atom approaches, modeling easier. The intention is that project_tools
will become a useful toolset for Clementi group members. It is intended to be
used with a complementary module, model_builder, which is responsible for
constructing simulation input files (e.g. Gromacs .gro and .top files)
