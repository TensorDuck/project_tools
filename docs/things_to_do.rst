Things To Keep in Mind
======================

Our overall coding goals:
1. Write code that is easy to understand and extend: style, design, and documentation.

  * Please force yourself to adhere to `PEP 8 style guide. <http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008>`_
    Standardizing our coding style promotes readability. 
    20 useful adages: `Zen of Python http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/`_

  * Program design and development is nontrivial. Ideally we would follow the 
    new school philosophy of `Agile development <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development>`_
    where development process involves many small iterations.

2. Write code that works: unit testing.

  * Code is broken until tested.


3. Write code that is efficient with time and memory.

These are roughly in order of decreasing importance.
