    Coming back to work on model_builder.py. Can currently run Go models to
look for melting temperature. This is the first step to calibrating the 
heterogeneous Go model.

    To Do Next:
1. Find the temperature interval where 0.25 < <Q> < 0.75 and then initiate
simulations spaced by 1K across this interval. 
    Expectations:
    - For two-state systems with a very steep melting curve this interval will
      be narrow.
    - For systems with multi-state kinetics this interval will be broader,
      potentially with intermediate plateaus.

2. Prep files for WHAM and run WHAM on the temperature range to get heat 
capacity. Then run WHAM to get 1D and 2D PMFs at the folding temperature.

3. Start 5 long equilibrium simulations at the folding temperature.


To Do at any time:
- Record information files so simulations can be picked up easily at the spot
they were left off. DONE

- Put model_builder on github. DONE

    Currently can get simulations all the way to computing WHAM Cv and
FreeEnergy on temperatures straddling the estimated folding temperature. Found
an issue with the definition of native contacts. Was trying to adapt the
algorithm left previously for determining the equilibrium distance for
contacts, but I found that a significant percentage of native contacts were
not being formed in the native ensemble. This was because the equilibrium
distances being assigned to those contacts was shorter than in the crystal 
structure, leaving gaps in the packing of inner residues.

    These vacancies don't have as much effect on proteins with mostly beta
structure because beta structure is more dense with contacts in a c-alpha
model; looking at the contact map it is clear that beta regions are broad
stripes of contacts while helix-helix packing is achieved with sparse
contacts. Consequently the percentage of contacts lost to the vacancies is
around ~10% for canonical globular proteins s6,sh3,1TEN,1TIT (also nmda
receptor). However, vacancies in the packing caused all-alpha proteins like
the spectrins to lose ~25-30% of contacts. This has an appreciable effect
since the helices are more rigid than beta sheets (in a c-alpha model), so the
native state was constrained from rearranging to satisfy the vacancies.

Protein  PDB  Crystal Conts.  Formed >90%   % Lost
  s6     1RIS     467             405         13
  sh3    1FMK     227             204         10
  Ig     1TEN     380             330         13
  Ig     1TIT     398             354         11
Rossman  3CHY     583             498         14
  nmda   1Y1Z     1507            1333        11
  r15             403             269         33
  r16             476             346         27
  r17             430             328         23

    Consequently, the folding behavior of the globular proteins s6,sh3,1TIT
1TEN all follow 2-state behavior. Their PMF with respect to Q has folded and
unfolded basins and a normal looking barrier. On the other hand the PMFs for
the spectrins look pretty wacky, with a destabilized native state and and
intermediate basin at lower Q. This underscores the necessity of getting the
definition of contacts correct.

    Now I'm going to switch to a more trusted algorithm. Two residues will be
considered in contact if there is a distance <=4.5A in the set of all 
pairwise inter-residue-heavy-atom distances. This should be done during
prep_system()

    Added functionality to compute native contacts with shadow map developed
by Jeff Noel, Paul Whitford in the Onuchic group (1). 

    Added new coordinate Nh which is number of helical residues. This is a
refinement of Qh (fraction of i+4 contacts) in that it also requires the
two dihedrals in between i and i+4 to be within +/-40 degrees of the alpha-
helical region 52 degrees. Using this we see that helices -are- unfolded in
the unfolded state because the thermal flucuations knock the dihedrals out
of their minima even if the i+4 contact is made. Hopefully this metric will
reveal if tertiary contacts stabilize helices.

    Added plot submodule to help with plotting. Currently not finished and 
only focused on plotting 1D,2D pmfs and contact maps for equilibrium data.

    Currently working on incorporating f^k_ij calculator for mutational 
data. Deciding on a format for the mutational data files. Using MODELLER
on my local machine to create many mutant pdbs, then bringing them to the
server to use pdb2gmx and shadow map, then parse output to get f^k_ij.

Future Plans:
- Want to use umbrella sampling along Q to generate free energy profiles
like the Onuchic and Wolynes group, then perform mutational algorithm to 
biased data.

    Implemented MODELLER in combination with ShadowMap to generate mutated
pbds for all mutations.

    Thinking of splitting model_builder into a package for preparing GROMACS
input files and a package for running simulation. The motivation is that
preparing Gromacs inputs is a general need to start messing around with more
complicated coarse-grain models (e.g. different bead models, as well as
different backbone potentials).

    Outlining how to split model_builder functionality between package that
prepares files and package that runs simulation. Sketching at what needs to 
be changed.

    New ideas to compartementalize Model and System objects from the main
logical flow:

    1.  Instead of creating 1 Model object for all subdirectories, create
        a list of Model object which hold the options for each the 
        corresponding system/subdirectory (e.g. disulfides, R_C/D, etc.)

    2.  Use universal model.info format, i.e. include all fields with 
        unused options just set blank lines. models.py can read in 
        model.info and check for consistency between options, output
        potential warning/error messages, and/or return corresponding
        Model object.
    
    3.  models.py can also check the arguments for a new model for 
        consistency (i.e. all required options present, no options are 
        contradictory). DONE

    4.  Put prepare_system into models.py(?) to separate its mess from the
        main logical loop.

    This way all the complex option handling can be pushed into models.py
and system.py.

Late Night Update:
    1.  Expanded models.py to do thorough checking of inputted options 
        and creation of Model objects.

    2.  Good idea to also create a parallel list of System objects for
        each subdirectory. This would clean up a lot of messy looping
        inside the System class. This would also make the Model and 
        System objects more symmetric and logical.

    Starting to reorganize the code to compartementalize the Model and System
objects so that each subdirectory is associated with a [Model,System] pair. 
To further separate the Model and System functionality:

    1.  Move all calculation functionality from System into Model. e.g.
        calculation of native contacts, getting atom indices.

    2.  Dealing with bonded interactions can be a submodule of models. e.g.
        CA_bonded.py, CACB_bonded.py, etc. This will further compartementalize
        the preparation of bonded versus non-bonded input files.

    Fernando and I also thought it would be helpful to have a command line
tool that spits out all the info we could want to know about a structure. For
example:
    Sequence info
        Sequence
        Length
        Number of types of residues (polar, charged, hydrophobic)
        
    Secondary Structural info (via STRIDE)
        Secondary structure assignment
        Number of and length of secondary structure elements
 
    Tertiary Structural info
        Number of (local,nonlocal,helical,total) contacts
        Fraction of local to nonlocal contacts
        Radius of gyration
        Contact order   
        Absolute contact order
        Estimate folding temperature 
        Loop length distribution (distribution of seq. separation for contacts)
        Distance distribution of native state (?)

    Finished tasks of separating Model and System functionality. Refactored
Model and System generation and included a function to check that inputs are
consistent with one another. For backwards compatibility system.info and 
model.info files can be updated to new format using the --dryrun option on the
command line.

    Replaced coord_util with MDTraj for computing native contacts. Much
faster! Moving forward to finish phi value calculation and MC2004
thermodynamic perturbation.

    Run into an error that some traj.xtc files were corrupted with the
following 'magic number' error, output from gmxcheck:

------------------ vvvvv ERROR vvvvv -------------------
Program gmxcheck, VERSION 4.5.5
Source code file: xtcio.c, line: 84

Fatal error:
Magic Number Error in XTC file (read 0, should be 1995)
For more information and tips for troubleshooting, please check the GROMACS
website at http://www.gromacs.org/Documentation/Errors
------------------ ^^^^^ ERROR ^^^^^ ------------------

    The magic number is a number at the beginning of each frame indicates to
gromacs that the file is indeed an XTC file (as opposed to a different
filetype with an .xtc extension). 

    Wrote a command line utility to check all traj.xtc files in subdirectories
with gmxcheck.

To Do Now:
    - Finish incorporating phi value calculation into main flow.
    - Start on thermodynamic pertrubation.

    Moving all the simulation tools into a different module called
project_tools. Only going to keep the models and systems submodules in this
repository.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alexander Kluber
    
    Split models/ and systems/ submodules into a new repository called
model_builder which will take care of prepping Gromacs input files for coarse
grain models. This repository is now called project_tools and will handle
running simulations according to different project 'recipes' (e.g. MC2004).

    TO DO:
- Potentially use logging module to replace print statements.
- Write unit tests.
- Write consistent docstrings.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alexander Kluber

    project_tools now holds several "recipes", pre-written procedures to
execute a particular logical flow. For example, to run the Matysiak Clementi
2004 algorithm one would run the MatysiakClementi2004.py recipe in recipes/.
