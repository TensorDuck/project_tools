    Coming back to work on model_builder.py. Can currently run Go models to
look for melting temperature. This is the first step to calibrating the 
heterogeneous Go model.

    To Do Next:
1. Find the temperature interval where 0.25 < <Q> < 0.75 and then initiate
simulations spaced by 1K across this interval. 
    Expectations:
    - For two-state systems with a very steep melting curve this interval will
      be narrow.
    - For systems with multi-state kinetics this interval will be broader,
      potentially with intermediate plateaus.

2. Prep files for WHAM and run WHAM on the temperature range to get heat 
capacity. Then run WHAM to get 1D and 2D PMFs at the folding temperature.

3. Start 5 long equilibrium simulations at the folding temperature.


To Do at any time:
- Record information files so simulations can be picked up easily at the spot
they were left off. DONE

- Put model_builder on github. DONE

    Currently can get simulations all the way to computing WHAM Cv and
FreeEnergy on temperatures straddling the estimated folding temperature. Found
an issue with the definition of native contacts. Was trying to adapt the
algorithm left previously for determining the equilibrium distance for
contacts, but I found that a significant percentage of native contacts were
not being formed in the native ensemble. This was because the equilibrium
distances being assigned to those contacts was shorter than in the crystal 
structure, leaving gaps in the packing of inner residues.

    These vacancies don't have as much effect on proteins with mostly beta
structure because beta structure is more dense with contacts in a c-alpha
model; looking at the contact map it is clear that beta regions are broad
stripes of contacts while helix-helix packing is achieved with sparse
contacts. Consequently the percentage of contacts lost to the vacancies is
around ~10% for canonical globular proteins s6,sh3,1TEN,1TIT (also nmda
receptor). However, vacancies in the packing caused all-alpha proteins like
the spectrins to lose ~25-30% of contacts. This has an appreciable effect
since the helices are more rigid than beta sheets (in a c-alpha model), so the
native state was constrained from rearranging to satisfy the vacancies.

Protein  PDB  Crystal Conts.  Formed >90%   % Lost
  s6     1RIS     467             405         13
  sh3    1FMK     227             204         10
  Ig     1TEN     380             330         13
  Ig     1TIT     398             354         11
Rossman  3CHY     583             498         14
  nmda   1Y1Z     1507            1333        11
  r15             403             269         33
  r16             476             346         27
  r17             430             328         23

    Consequently, the folding behavior of the globular proteins s6,sh3,1TIT
1TEN all follow 2-state behavior. Their PMF with respect to Q has folded and
unfolded basins and a normal looking barrier. On the other hand the PMFs for
the spectrins look pretty wacky, with a destabilized native state and and
intermediate basin at lower Q. This underscores the necessity of getting the
definition of contacts correct.

    Now I'm going to switch to a more trusted algorithm. Two residues will be
considered in contact if there is a distance <=4.5A in the set of all 
pairwise inter-residue-heavy-atom distances. This should be done during
prep_system()

    Added functionality to compute native contacts with shadow map developed
by Jeff Noel, Paul Whitford in the Onuchic group (1). 

    Added new coordinate Nh which is number of helical residues. This is a
refinement of Qh (fraction of i+4 contacts) in that it also requires the
two dihedrals in between i and i+4 to be within +/-40 degrees of the alpha-
helical region 52 degrees. Using this we see that helices -are- unfolded in
the unfolded state because the thermal flucuations knock the dihedrals out
of their minima even if the i+4 contact is made. Hopefully this metric will
reveal if tertiary contacts stabilize helices.

    Added plot submodule to help with plotting. Currently not finished and 
only focused on plotting 1D,2D pmfs and contact maps for equilibrium data.

    Currently working on incorporating f^k_ij calculator for mutational 
data. Deciding on a format for the mutational data files. Using MODELLER
on my local machine to create many mutant pdbs, then bringing them to the
server to use pdb2gmx and shadow map, then parse output to get f^k_ij.

Future Plans:
- Want to use umbrella sampling along Q to generate free energy profiles
like the Onuchic and Wolynes group, then perform mutational algorithm to 
biased data.
