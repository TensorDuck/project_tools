    Coming back to work on model_builder.py. Can currently run Go models to
look for melting temperature. This is the first step to calibrating the 
heterogeneous Go model.

    To Do Next:
1. Find the temperature interval where 0.25 < <Q> < 0.75 and then initiate
simulations spaced by 1K across this interval. 
    Expectations:
    - For two-state systems with a very steep melting curve this interval will
      be narrow.
    - For systems with multi-state kinetics this interval will be broader,
      potentially with intermediate plateaus.

2. Prep files for WHAM and run WHAM on the temperature range to get heat 
capacity. Then run WHAM to get 1D and 2D PMFs at the folding temperature.

3. Start 5 long equilibrium simulations at the folding temperature.


To Do at any time:
- Record information files so simulations can be picked up easily at the spot
they were left off.

- Put model_builder on github.
